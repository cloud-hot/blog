After years of renting out rooms, we understand the challenges landlords face when it comes to communication with prospective tenants. Your daily routine often involves replying to the same inquiries repeatedly across various channels. As a landlord or small business owner, you may not have the budget to invest in commercial customer service tools, leaving you overwhelmed and struggling to manage these repetitive tasks efficiently.

So, We asked ourselives, why not create a simple tool tailored for people like us? Our goal is to empower small business owners and individuals with an invisible AI assistant that can automatically reply to common inquiries, freeing you from the burden of repetitive messaging across multiple platforms.
