## Why I built directory?  
I want to build a passive income with valuable tool or website. At the same time, I am new to web development. So I want to learn build a well designed website with the help of cursor. I choose this niche because I am also an AMI-trained Montessori educator and dad. So I decided to build my first directory—a platform to help parents easily find the best childcare: **[DaycareSpot](https://www.daycarespot.com/)**.  

## 💡 Tech Stack I Used

## **Building a Directory is Easier Than Ever… Thanks to AI**  
Nowadays, with **powerful AI tools**, you don’t even need coding experience to build a directory. There are also **no-code options** like Frey recommended using **WordPress templates**.  

I spent **one month** building my directory. In reality, I could have launched the first version in just a few days—but I care deeply about **design and user experience**, so I focused on refining it. I finally launched in early **February** (I wish I had launched it earlier!).  

## **The Hardest Part? Getting Traffic.**  
Fast forward **one month after launch…**  

### 📊 Google Search Console Stats:

## **What I Haven’t Done Yet?**

## **My Key Takeaways So Far:**  
🚀 **Building the directory is the easiest part—getting traffic is the hardest.** SEO, content, and outreach take real effort.
