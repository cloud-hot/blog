After reading the article [Recreating the Google Logo Animation with SVG and Greensock](https://css-tricks.com/recreating-the-google-logo-animation-with-svg-and-greensock/), I decided to recreate it using the same technique but with the help of Cursor AI. I will record all the process and share it with you. Through this process, I am exploring how to use natural language to generate SVG animation code. Hopefully, I will find a way to make it easier for non-technical people to create SVG animations.

The whole process will include the following steps:

1. Generate SVG for animation.
2. Describe the animation in natural language.
3. Let Cursor generate the animation code.
4. Iterate on the animation code until it looks as expected.
